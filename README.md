# vue-authenticate
`vue-authenticate` is easily configurable solution for *Vue.js* that provides local login/registration as well as Social login using Github, Facebook, Google and Twitter OAuth providers.

The best part about this library is that it is not strictly coupled to one request handling library like `vue-resource`. You will be able to use it with different libraries. 

For now it is tested to work with  `vue-resource` and `axios` (using `vue-axios` wrapper).

This library was inspired by well known authentication library for Angular called [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer) developed by [Sahat Yalkabov](http://sahatyalkabov.com). They share almost identical configuration and API so you can easily switch from Angular to Vue.js project.

## Instalation
`npm install vue-authenticate`

## Usage
```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueResource from 'vue-resource'
import VueAuthenticate from '../src/index.js'

Vue.use(VueRouter)
Vue.use(VueResource)

Vue.use(VueAuthenticate, {
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4000',
  
  providers: {
    github: {
      clientId: '91b3c6a5b8411640e1b3',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080/auth/callback'
    }
  }
}
```

### Email & password login and registration
```javascript
new Vue({
  methods: {
    login: function () {
      this.$auth.login({ email, password }).then(function () {
        // Execute application logic after successful login
      })
    },

    register: function () {
      this.$auth.register({ name, email, password }).then(function () {
        // Execute application logic after successful registration
      })
    }
  }
})
```

### Social authentication

```javascript
new Vue({
  methods: {
    authenticate: function (provider) {
      this.$auth.authenticate(provider).then(function () {
        // Execute application logic after successful social authentication
      })
    }
  }
})
```

```html
<button @click="authenticate('github')">auth Github</button>
<button @click="authenticate('facebook')">auth Facebook</button>
<button @click="authenticate('google')">auth Google</button>
<button @click="authenticate('twitter')">auth Twitter</button>
```
